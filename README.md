# Simple Authentication and Preferences App

## Project Overview
This application demonstrates a simple authentication system with local storage to persist user sessions, preferences for light/dark mode, and filter settings.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in with a username and stay logged in across page reloads.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes, with their choice saved to local storage.
- **Filtering**: A filter setting that, when applied, will persist until the user clears it.

## How to Use
1. **Login**: Enter a username to log in. User data is saved to local storage.
2. **Dark Mode**: Toggle the checkbox to switch themes. This setting will persist.
3. **Filtering**: Click the "Apply Filter" button to simulate filtering. This setting will persist.
